    401k pre and post tax savings calculator and optimizer.
    The goal of the optimizer is to find N paycheck contributions as close
    to contributing slightly over the cap for the entire year. The ideal is
    1 cent over.

    The optimizer can be re-run as the year progresses to help rebalance as
    numbers become more concrete during the year: salary increase, actual
    rebalancing dates, etc.

    Ground rules for the optimizer:
      * Payments across boundaries can only change by a small percent to best
        smooth changes over the year and keep net pay as constant as possible.
      * As frugal a number of changes as possible. The optimizer supports
        at most 3 (start, increase, tweak) but also tests for the case
        when 2 or all 3 are the same. Changes take time to propgate online
        and changing across multiple pay period windows can cause timing
        problems.
      * Always contribute as close to the cap. This is a sound financial
        strategy and also ensures employer matching for pre-tax without a
        true-up event (not guaranteed).

    The change intervals:
      * start    : The rate at the start of the year until the first paycheck
                   with the employees salary increase.
      * increase : The rate after salary increase takes place to TODAY.
      * tweak    : A sweep of all remaining pay-periods from TODAY to the end
                   of the year.

    TODAY in this context refers to the day the program is executed. Any pay
    periods within tweak_limit calendar days of TODAY are considered too
    close to alter and are treated as part of the increase interval.
